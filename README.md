This is a list of some exercises I did when in college. Enjoy!

# Information Retrieval Papers Study
This is a summary, that was conducted from the study of 3 papers that are relevant to Data Compression. Various Huffman Coding techniques are presented and there is a brief presentation to other forms of data compression like Arithmetic Encoding and Assymetric Numeral Systems Encoding.

# Communication Algorithms
This is a set of exercises that were assigned as tasks by our professor. More specifically, in the files are presented solutions for specific algorithmic problems regarding communication in different nodes of a system. That type of problems are very common in a variety of Computer Science fields.

# Networks Laboratory
This is a set of results that came out from assigned tasks during the whole semester. Wireshark, a widely-used network protocol analyzer tool played an important part in the implementation process and there was also a part that was theoretical and focused in the understanding of IP assignment and Network sub-Networks and Masks. 

# Scientific Computing
Scientific Computing was a difficult set of exercises. They focused on basic understanding of Tables and calculations amongs different tables and were also covering more complex subjects. The programming language that was used was Matlab and its a project I would rather forget pretty quickly.

# Assembly Lab
That was my first lab attendance in College. It was awful until I understood what the exercises were about. Assembly programming was not something that I was thrilled about but generally I could say that it was an interesting lab. You can find all the exercises I've done.

# Microprogramming Lab
That lab was the lowest form of programming and by studying this subject I could see why it has been abandoned for almost three decades now. Microprogramming is like talking to the machines at their Language, which in a way, that's exactly what it is.
